# DroneVisionControl

Program that uses shape detection from a video feed to control a drone.
This uses a Raspberry Pi (B+) and the Ardupilot flight computer for control and the raspberry camera as video feed

The program tries to keep the detected shape in the center of the schreen by turning 
and keep its size by moving forward or backward
